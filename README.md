# 💎 Bijou

## Turbo TUI engine for TypeScript.

**Resilient by design. Physics-powered. Built for scale.**

Stop building brittle CLIs that break in CI or look like garbage on a server. Bijou is a multi-package TUI engine for building everything from simple interactive scripts to complex, high-fidelity terminal applications.

## What's New in v0.8.0

**Command Palette, Tooltip, Color Utils & DAG Tokens** — four high-value non-breaking features:

- **`commandPalette()`** — filterable action list with case-insensitive search, viewport scrolling, and vim-style keymap
- **`tooltip()`** — positioned overlay with top/bottom/left/right direction and screen-edge clamping
- **Color manipulation** — `lighten()`, `darken()`, `mix()`, `complementary()`, `saturate()`, `desaturate()` on theme tokens
- **`DagNode` token expansion** — `labelToken` and `badgeToken` for granular per-node text styling

See the [full changelog](./docs/CHANGELOG.md) for the complete technical breakdown.

## 🦾 Resilience as a Superpower

The core of Bijou is its **Graceful Degradation** engine. It detects your environment and automatically adapts the UI logic—ensuring your tool works as perfectly in a GitHub Action as it does in a local TrueColor terminal.

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interactive** | Local TTY | Full 24-bit RGB, Unicode borders, 60fps physics animations. |
| **Static** | `CI=true` | Single-frame rendering, animations disabled, spinners removed. |
| **Pipe** | Piped `stdout` | Strips all ANSI codes, switches to ASCII fallbacks for UNIX pipes. |
| **Accessible** | `BIJOU_A11Y=1` | Simplified prompt text and linear flow optimized for screen readers. |

---

## 🛠️ One Engine, Two Runtimes

Bijou is split into two layers so you only pay for what you need:

### 1. The Resilient Core (`@flyingrobots/bijou`)
A zero-dependency library of 20+ "pure-render" components and interactive prompts.
*   **Hexagonal Architecture:** Decoupled from Node.js. Test your UI logic in pure TS with zero mocks.
*   **First-class Design Tokens:** (DTCG-compatible) Use your web brand's JSON to drive your terminal's theme.
*   **Built-in Resilience:** Native support for CI, pipes, and screen readers.

### 2. The High-Performance TUI (`@flyingrobots/bijou-tui`)
An interactive runtime inspired by **The Elm Architecture (TEA)** and **GSAP**.
*   **Physics-Based Motion:** Damped harmonic oscillators (Springs) for 60fps-smooth interfaces.
*   **Flexbox Layout:** A real `flex()` engine with auto-reflow that actually understands terminal resizing.
*   **Animation Timelines:** Orchestrate complex sequences with GSAP-style position syntax (`+=`, `-=`).

## 📊 Feature Comparison: Bijou vs. Ink

While **Ink** is the standard for React-based TUIs, Bijou is built for developers who need an industrial-grade engine without the overhead of a DOM-like reconciler.

| Feature | **Bijou** | **Ink** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** | Monolithic (Node-only) |
| **Logic** | Pure TypeScript (Zero-deps) | React / Yoga-layout |
| **State** | **The Elm Architecture (TEA)** | Hooks / Component State |
| **Resilience** | **Native Graceful Degradation** | Manual / Environment-sensitive |
| **Animation** | **Physics-Based Springs** | Simple Tweens / Ad-hoc |
| **Testability** | **Mock-free (via Port Adapters)** | Requires Terminal Emulation |
| **Performance**| **Physics-driven 60fps+** | Reconciler-bound |

## Quick Start

### 1. Interactive Prompts (Core)
Beautiful prompts that automatically degrade to numbered lists in CI environments.

```typescript
import { initDefaultContext } from '@flyingrobots/bijou-node';
import { input, select, group } from '@flyingrobots/bijou';

initDefaultContext();

const setup = await group({
  project: () => input({ title: 'Project Name', required: true }),
  type:    () => select({ 
    title: 'Template', 
    options: [{ label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts' }, { label: 'Go', value: 'go' }] 
  }),
});
```

### 2. Full-Scale TUI (Runtime)
Unidirectional state management with physics-based animations. (See [demo-tui.ts](./demo-tui.ts))

```typescript
import { run, quit, type App, type KeyMsg } from '@flyingrobots/bijou-tui';

type Model = { count: number };

const app: App<Model, never> = {
  init: () => [{ count: 0 }, []],
  update: (msg, model) => {
    if (msg.type === 'key') {
      if (msg.key === 'q') return [model, [quit()]];
      if (msg.key === '+') return [{ count: model.count + 1 }, []];
    }
    return [model, []];
  },
  view: (model) => `Count: ${model.count}\nPress + to increment, q to quit`
};

run(app);
```
